we have a button on click of which counter changes and document title is updated and 
also we have a textbox on change oif which name is changed 
when button is clicked or textbox value is changed state is changed  and hence useEffect is called

now we need a way to call useEffect only when button is clicked i.e when counter is changed
means it should not depend on "name "
